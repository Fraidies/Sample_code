# Sample_code
Examples of projects I've worked on.
Unfortunately I lost a great deal of work when I upgraded to windows 10, some of which I would have loved to display as sample code.

Assignment0_noDataStructures:
	This was the very first programming assignment for a data structures class, (CPSC350) providing us the challenge of programming without the use of any data structures.


Assignment1_gameOfLife:
	Illustrates the very first attempt at using data structues for CPSC350


Assignment3_delimChecker:
	I provided this as an example of a simpler program with considerably more effort placed into quality with use of different data structures.


 SE320-01_grp_project
	This was a gorup project I contributed to in a "Software Development Lifecycle" class. I contributed to the architecture of our project, as well as junit testing and portions of the design document such as the class and component diagrams.
