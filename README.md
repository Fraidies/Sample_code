# Sample_code
Examples of projects I've worked on.
Unfortunately I lost a great deal of work when I upgraded to windows 10, some of which I would have loved to display as sample code. What I have here to show is recent code from what is notoriously the most difficult programming class offered at Chapman university; CPSC350 Data Structures and Algorithms.

Assignment0_noDataStructures:
	This was the very first programming assignment for a data structures class, (CPSC350) providing us the challenge of programming without the use of any data structures.


Assignment1_gameOfLife:
	Illustrates the very first attempt at using data structues for CPSC350


Assignment3_delimChecker:
	I provided this as an example of a simpler program with considerably more effort placed into readability with use of different data structures.
